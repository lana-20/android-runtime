# Android RunTime (ART)

__Dalvik__ was the original virtual machine (VM) used in Android to run applications written in Java. 
Dalvik was designed to be memory-efficient and optimized for mobile devices, with features like just-in-time (JIT) compilation and garbage collection. 
Dalvik was designed to be compact and efficient, allowing Android devices to run apps on limited resources.

In Android 4.4 (KitKat), the Dalvik VM was replaced with the __Android Runtime (ART)__, which provides improved performance and support for new features.

ART (Android RunTime) is the default runtime environment in Android devices, and is used to execute Android applications. ART works by compiling the application code into an optimized machine code format, rather than interpreting the code at runtime as was the case with the older Dalvik runtime. This allows for improved performance and battery life on Android devices.

Examples of how ART is used in Android include:

1. Faster App Launch Times: ART compiles the application code into machine code, which results in faster app launch times compared to the older Dalvik runtime.

2. Improved Battery Life: ART performs runtime optimizations that can result in improved battery life, as the device does not need to constantly interpret the application code.

3. Improved Application Performance: ART's compiler optimizes the application code for the specific device it is running on, resulting in improved performance compared to the older Dalvik runtime.

4. Improved Garbage Collection: ART includes a more advanced garbage collection system, which helps to reduce memory usage and improve overall system performance.

Overall, ART is an important part of the Android operating system, and its use results in a more optimized and efficient Android experience for users.
